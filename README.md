Here it is the Movie library app for one time session
first page consist of user login/user sign up 
You can sign up and after that sign in with username and password.
I have already created a demo userName='Arindam' and Password='ari@123'.You can use it to login
then after logging in it is navigated to the other page that is the movie library website
In the header that is top section there is searchbar to search the name of the movie, then a card style page will appear containing the details of the movie
On the top right corner is the log out button that will come out of the page.
Below the details of the card there is add to list button, Click on the button then it will add it to the list on the right side of page where playlist is written
It will keep on adding in the list once you click on add to list button on different movies
